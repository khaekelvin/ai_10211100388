Subsections:
a) Regression Problem[6 marks]
Build a regression model to predict a continuous variable based on user-provided input data.
Requirements:
1. Allow users to upload a regression related, specify the naming of the expected target column
in the dataset (e.g., CSV file).
2. Implement a simple linear regression model (such as predicting house prices based on features
like size, location, etc.).
3. Display results, including model performance metrics (e.g., Mean Absolute Error, R² score)
and a scatter plot of predictions vs. actual values.
4. Enable users to input custom data to make predictions.
Expected Features:
• Dataset preview.
• Data preprocessing options.
• Visualization of the regression line.
b) Clustering[6 marks]
Perform clustering on a dataset and visualize the results.
Requirements:
1. Allow users to upload a dataset with multiple features (e.g., customer segmentation data).
2. Use the K-Means Clustering algorithm to group data points into clusters.
3. Visualize the clusters using scatter plots (if 2D) or 3D visualizations (if possible).
4. Enable users to select the number of clusters interactively.
Expected Features:
• Interactive slider for selecting the number of clusters.
• Visualization of cluster centroids and cluster memberships.
• Downloadable clustered dataset.
c) Neural Network[6 marks]
Design and train a neural network on user-uploaded data.
Requirements:
1. Allow users to upload a dataset for classification tasks, specify the target column name (such
as MNIST digits dataset or custom CSV).
2. Build a simple Feedforward Neural Network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
3. Display training and validation accuracy/loss during the training process.
4. Provide an option for users to make predictions on new data using the trained model.
Expected Features:
• Real-time training progress visualization (e.g., loss/accuracy graphs).
• Option to tweak hyperparameters (e.g., epochs, learning rate).
• Upload custom test samples for prediction.
d) Large Language Model (LLM)[10 mark]
Develop a Large Language Model Solution, Q&A, with the following requirements.
Requirements:
1. Use an open sources pre-trained LLM model such as mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1, etc
choose ONE LLM approach below and ONE Dataset to perform natural language processing
task such as Question and answers from the custom data.
i. LLM Approach:

Statement-and-Economic-Policy_v4.pdf
2. Draw the architecture for the approach.
3. Explain the methodology in detail
4. Allow users to perform Q & A tasks.
5. Display the generated responses in real time.
Expected Features:
• Input box for text queries.
• Display confidence scores or additional metadata.
